Yoko Ono is the latest to say she’s done with New York City.

The 90-year-old is choosing to spend the rest of her life in a rural upstate New York farm that she and her late husband, John Lennon, purchased together in 1978, according to the Daily Mail.

In the last 50 years, Ono has called the exclusive Dakota building — located on West 72nd Street and known as the first-ever luxury apartment building in America — her home. Lennon was shot outside, in Dakota’s archway, on Dec. 8, 1980.

During the pandemic, Ono opted to move to her expansive 600-acre farm near Franklin, New York, in the Catskills, full-time — with no plans of returning to her Upper West Side abode, the outlet reported.

Ono and The Beatles legend had purchased the farm initially as a retreat — and to raise Holstein dairy cows.

The farm is located in upstate New York and spans a colossal 600 acres.

Ono now lives a “peaceful life,” out of the public spotlight, sources say, adding that the small town has a population of just 340 people.

The main house on the sprawling estate has four bedrooms and two bathrooms — and outside, Ono grows her own vegetables. Nearby are a farmers’ market and a pizza restaurant.

Philip Norman, in his book, “John Lennon: The Life,” writes that the English singer bought a herd of 122 cows and 10 bulls for the farm at one point.

Back in 2013, the farm became a subject of contention, when Ono and her son, Sean, protested fracking in the state of New York. There was a rising threat to the farm that sits atop the Marcellus Shale — a rock formation geologists estimate holds trillions of cubic feet of natural gas.

“I have always felt lucky,” Lennon wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times, “to live on land [my father] loved dearly.”

Despite being wheelchair-bound with her health declining in recent years, Ono recently revealed that she goes for 4-mile walks to beat depression.

Ono never remarried following the assassination of Lennon.

In 2017, now 47-year-old Sean pushed Ono in a wheelchair to receive the National Music Publishers’ Association’s Centennial Song award.

“I’ve learned so much from having this illness,” Ono said during her acceptance speech. “I’m thankful I went through that.”

It still remains unclear what illness she was referring to, but in 2020, a source close to her staff told The Post that the avant-garde artist requires round-the-clock care. Before moving out to her farm, the source added that she rarely left her sprawling apartment in the Dakota.

Born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1933, Ono was born into a banking family who suffered from starvation during World War II. They were often forced to barter household items for food while they sought refuge from Allied bombing raids.

“She is a particularly special being,” Elliot Mintz, a close family friend and publicist, told The Post back in 2020. “In these 87 years, she’s lived 400.”

I was never into the Beatles, or Lennon,  Granted  their music are the Classics of R&R.  In the mid 80's,    I was working in NYC  Doing some Custom Renovation Work.  I was so fortunate   to  go into the Dakota  and in the Lennon  Home.  She had a closet  with 12 foot ceilings with 4 circular racks...

Randy...this is really a cool post. So easy to just make a bad joke about a woman at 90 wanting to move to green pastures,

As  so many have done.

You are not a fan of Lennon...you are a fan of class and graciousness. A man reporting what he saw and felt and not making blind assumptions about Yoko or....

My NYC Yoko story was while I was waiting to be seated at Il Molino's in the Village. At the time (1984), this was an exclusive place and we were waiting over one hour, with reservations, to be seated. Yoko breezed in with Sean and demanded to be seated. The maitre-d took a firm stand and told her ...

My Yoko Ono story was from 2000. I was working for a food pantry supported by a church in midtown. We invited Ms. Ono to host the event. She called to personally apologize for not being able to be there. She was very polite and apologetic. And generous. Sir Elton John also called personally to decl...

That farm must be one of the "no possessions" Mr. Lennon imagined to go along with her $700 million net worth and the five apartments they owned in the Dakota, NYC's most exclusive and excluding address.

Imagine no possessions except for me not you 

Don't take my cows and houses because I'm rich like Bernie Sanders, too

You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one

Maybe someday you'll move to New York,  and have to buy a stun gun
